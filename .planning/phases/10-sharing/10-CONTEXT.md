# Phase 10: Sharing - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-11
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

Social-first sharing experience optimized for Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms. When someone finds a joke they love, they should be able to share it instantly with a beautiful, eye-catching share card that makes people want to click and discover more jokes.

The share cards should be context-themed — different visual styles for different joke types. A dad joke card should look/feel different from a dark humor card or a pun card. This creates variety in feeds and helps the content stand out.

The experience should feel viral-ready: beautiful previews, one-tap sharing, and a rating system that helps surface the best jokes to everyone.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Beautiful share cards** — The visual preview is what makes people click and share more. Cards need to look amazing in social feeds.
- **Frictionless sharing** — One tap to share anywhere. Speed and ease matter.
- **Rating drives discovery** — User ratings should help surface the best jokes to others, feeding back into the recommendation system.

All three are equally important and work together to create the viral loop.

## What's Out of Scope

- Comments/replies — No social discussion features. Just rate and share. Social commentary stays on the platforms where jokes are shared.
- User-submitted jokes — Not in this phase
- Advanced analytics dashboard — Track share events for data, but don't build a fancy visualization yet

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Context-themed share cards: Different visual treatments for dad jokes, dark humor, puns, one-liners, etc.
- Rating system: No strong preference on thumbs up/down vs 1-5 scale — optimize for what feeds recommendations best
- Share should work smoothly to major platforms: Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, iMessage

## Additional Context

This is the viral growth engine for Jokes For. The combination of beautiful share cards + easy sharing + rating feedback loop should drive organic discovery and user acquisition.

Focus is on making shared jokes look so good that recipients want to find more jokes themselves.
